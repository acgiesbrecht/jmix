# Jmix Authorization Server

**CAUTION: This add-on is now in the incubating state and its API and behavior may be modified in the future minor and patch releases.**

## Add-On Overview

Jmix Authorization Server add-on is built on top of [Spring Authorization Server](https://spring.io/projects/spring-authorization-server). Jmix Authorization Server is a replacement of the Jmix Security OAuth2 module that depends on outdated [Spring Security OAuth](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security-oauth) project that has reach end of life.

The Jmix Authorization Server add-on features:

* Contains predefined Spring configurations for working as participant with "authorization server" and "resource server" roles described in OAuth 2.1 protocol flows. This means that your Jmix application may issue access and refresh tokens and protect API resources with these tokens.
* Supports authorization code grant type for web clients and mobile devices.
* Supports client credentials grant type for server-to-server interaction.

## Auto-Configuration

When the add-on is included to the application the auto-configuration does initial setup:

* `SecurityFilterChai`n is added to the OAuth2 protocol endpoints (token endpoint, authorization endpoint etc.). 
* `SecurityFilterChain` for login form is added
* `InMemoryClientRepository` is registered
* Default `RegisteredClientProvider` is registered that creates a RegisteredClient based on application properties (read below)
* `SecurityFilterChain` for resource server configuration (URLs that must be protected using access tokens)

If you want to completely disable default auto-configuration and provide your own one, set the following application property:

```properties
jmix.authorization-server.use-default-configuration=false
```

## RegisteredClientProvider

The interface is used to provide a list of `RegisteredClient` that must be added to the clients repository. You may define your own implementations of the interface in the project. The add-on provides the default implementation `DefaultRegisteredClientProvider` that register a single client that may be configured using application properties.

```properties
jmix.authorization-server.default-client.client-id=someclient
jmix.authorization-server.default-client.client-secret={noop}somesecret
jmix.authorization-server.default-client.access-token-time-to-live=60m
jmix.authorization-server.default-client.refresh-token-time-to-live=10d
```

## Protecting API Endpoints 

The authorization server add-on by default checks the access token when accessing the following URLs:

* URLs of REST API add-on (/rest/**)
* URLs returned by implementations of the `io.jmix.core.security.AuthorizedUrlsProvider` interface
* URLs defined in the `jmix.rest.authenticated-url-patterns` application property

Token introspection is performed by checking that the token from request header exists in the `OAuth2AuthorizationService`.
